Part 1: Theoretical Analysis (40%)
Q1: Edge AI and Its Advantages
Edge AI performs data processing and inference directly on local devices (e.g., smartphones, drones) rather than relying solely on cloud infrastructure. This reduces latency because there’s no need to transmit data back and forth to cloud servers—decisions happen in milliseconds. It also enhances privacy since sensitive data (like health or facial recognition data) doesn't leave the device.

Example: In autonomous drones, Edge AI enables real-time obstacle detection and navigation without delays caused by remote servers, ensuring immediate reaction in dynamic environments.

Q2: Quantum AI vs Classical AI in Optimization
Classical AI algorithms (e.g., gradient descent) solve optimization problems using deterministic methods, which can be time-consuming for large, complex datasets. Quantum AI leverages quantum bits (qubits) to process multiple possibilities simultaneously, allowing faster convergence in complex optimization landscapes.

Industries that could benefit:

Pharmaceuticals: Speeding up molecular simulations for drug discovery.

Finance: Portfolio optimization and fraud detection.

Logistics: Route optimization for large fleets.

Q3: Societal Impact of Human-AI Collaboration in Healthcare
Human-AI collaboration enables healthcare professionals to make better decisions. For example, radiologists can use AI to detect anomalies in X-rays more accurately, improving diagnostic precision. Nurses may use AI tools to monitor patient vitals and predict deterioration, allowing early intervention.

This collaboration reshapes roles—not replacing professionals but enhancing their capabilities, reducing burnout, and increasing healthcare quality.

Task 3: Ethics in Personalized Medicine (300 words)
Using AI for treatment recommendations based on genomic data risks amplifying healthcare inequalities. The Cancer Genomic Atlas, like many biomedical datasets, underrepresents ethnic minorities. This can lead to biased models that suggest less effective treatments for these groups, worsening disparities.

Bias Types:

Sampling bias: Underrepresentation of non-white populations.

Label bias: Misclassification due to inconsistent diagnostic labeling.

Mitigation Strategies:

Diverse Data Curation: Ensure datasets include varied ethnic and demographic data.

Fairness Tools: Implement frameworks like IBM AI Fairness 360 to detect and correct biased predictions.

Regular Audits: Conduct post-deployment audits to ensure equitable outcomes.

Clinician Oversight: Ensure AI is used as an assistive tool, not a replacement, especially in sensitive cases.

Promoting fairness isn’t just ethical—it’s crucial for safe and accurate patient care.
